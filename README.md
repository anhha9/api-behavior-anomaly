# API Security: Access Behavior Anomaly
## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be accessed through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tangodelta/api-access-behaviour-anomaly-dataset?resource=download) (licensed under GPL-2)

Applications built on distributed microservices are commonly accessed through APIs. The author of this dataset gathered sequences of API calls from an application and organized them into a graph structure. From this graph, they derived typical API access patterns (i.e., sequences of API calls) and calculated user access metrics to help classify these behaviors. Additionally, the author of this dataset manually labeled a subset of these behavior patterns as a training set and provided the remaining sequences for classification.
